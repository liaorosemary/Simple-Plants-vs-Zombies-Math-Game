## Running the game

The game can be run using the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download).

You can pause the game 

## Game plot
You're hanging out with Crazy Dave at the club. Suddenly, you hear a *Bang!* The zombies have broken in!

Your task is to protect Crazy Dave and kill the zombies before they reach the end of the disco floor and eat up Crazy Dave's brainz!!!

Oh, and did I mention, you have become a special peashooter capable of moving to any of the disco floor rows (i.e: you can move up and down to shoot peas at the zombies), but at the expense of having to answer simple math questions to shoot. Also, you can only move up and down the rows, and not across the columns.

Good luck!

## Game rules
Answer the simple math questions shown on the the disco ball at the top of the screen to shoot at the zombies.

A zombie can only die when it is hit by 3 peas, and as you get closer to that goal, the zombies become more and more transparent, until it is killed. NOTE: the zombies are still capable of eating brainz, even while becoming more transparent.

Also, keep in mind that different zombie move at different speeds. In order of slowest to fastest, the speeds for the zombies are: Micahel Jackson < Skate boarder < Roller skater.

## What happens when I win?
If you win, you will be given the chance to replay the game at a higher level (which will have more zombies).

## What happens if I lose?
You will be required to restart.
